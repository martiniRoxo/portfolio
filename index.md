## About me
I have no professional experience in game development, but it is one of my passions. For that reason, I have dedicated some of my free time on gaming projects. I've learned how to develop in Unity, mastered C# and learned as much as I could in pixel art design. Here you can find some of the games and prototypes I've developed.

## Unnamed Isometric ARPG Prototype

My earnest attempt at making a game ended when I accepted that it was too much for one single person. Not that it is impossible, but the scope of what I had in mind required too much time for something to be done as a hobby.

Still, I had a lot of fun developing this prototype and I was able to explore some interesting ideas.

Both the isometric look of the game and the story-heavy I had planned for it were inspired on titles such as Final Fantasy Tactics. Even though the game was not played by turns, I decided to keep the game elements locked to a grid logic. I felt this was the best approach to limit the scope and be able to assert more control over the gameplay.
