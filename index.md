## About me
I'm a Technical Lead passionate about gaming and software development. This portfolio shows how I have been exploring the intersection of these two interests. I have dedicated some of my free time to game development and learned how to create games with Unity and C#. In these projects I've also gained a lot of experience as a pixel artist.

Here you can find some of the games and prototypes I've developed. In these projects I designed and implemented complete systems end-to-end, from gameplay architecture to backend integrations and deployment.

Note that this portfolio is being expanded. I'm currently adding the technical considerations on the Prototype page. The in-depth pages for my other projects will be added later.

## Unnamed Isometric ARPG Prototype

<b>Tech & dev tools:</b> C#, Unity, Aseprite, Visual Studio, Audacity

With this project I was aiming at creating a fully fledged story-driven game with well thought-out gameplay mechanics. I focused on building modular gameplay systems that could scale into a full production-ready architecture. I developed robust cutscene management and conversation logic as well as exploration and combat systems.<br>

I had a lot of fun with this project. I was able to develop interesting gameplay systems and explored a lot of interesting game design ideas.

Both the isometric look of the game and the story-heavy elements I had planned were inspired by titles such as Final Fantasy Tactics.

## Portugal Tourism GP 

<b>Tech & dev tools:</b> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, REST APIs, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), C#, Unity, Aseprite, Visual Studio, Audacity

Portugal Tourism GP! is an isometric platformer pixel art game developed and published on iOS, Android and Steam (Windows, Linux and macOS). Players choose a European stereotype (think baguettes and pizzas) to race through the different locations in Portugal. In each level, players must navigate unique challenges and objectives and try to reach the end of the level with some money left.

As a finished, published game, this project exposed me to new challenges. At this point I was already familiar with the full technical lifecycle of the Unity project, but the online features required extensive work on the backend infrastructure. The cross-platform release also demanded new considerations as the game now required adaptations for each specific platform.

PTGP included online features such as public leaderboards and direct competitive races in streamed events, with prizes for the winners. To enable these competitions, I developed secure APIs to connect the game to its server to submit and update the scores. For the race events, I developed a custom Unity app to display the scores, replays, sketches and also allow the players to interact with the stream itself via the game (emotes such as thumbs up, thumbs down, tomatoes, among others).

Finally I developed a website that showed all the information on the game, hosted the APIs and also displayed the leaderboards.
