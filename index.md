## About me
I have no professional experience in game development, but it is one of my passions. For that reason, I have dedicated some of my free time on gaming projects. I've learned to develop in Unity, mastered C# and learned as much as I could in pixel art design. Here you can find some of the games and prototypes I've developed.

## Unnamed Isometric ARPG Prototype

My earnest attempt at making a game ended when I accepted that it was too much for one single person. Not that it is impossible, but the scope of what I had in mind required too much time for something to be done after hours.

Still, I had a lot of fun developing this prototype and I was able to explore some interesting ideas.

Both the isometric look of the game and the story heavy planned for it was inspired on titles such as Final Fantasy Tactics. Even though the game was not played by turns, I decided to keep the game elements locked to a grid logic. I felt this was the best approach to limit the scope and be able to assert more control over the gameplay.
