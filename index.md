## About me
I'm a Technical Lead passionate about gaming and software development. This portfolio shows how I have been exploring the intersection of these two interests. I have dedicated some of my free time to game development and learned how to create games in Unity and C#. In these projects I've also gained a lot of experience as a pixel artist.

Here you can find some of the games and prototypes I've developed.

Note that this portfolio is currently being expanded. I'm currently adding the technical considerations on the Prototype page. The in-depth pages for my other projects will be added later.

## Unnamed Isometric ARPG Prototype

This prototype resulted from my earnest attempt at making a fully fledged story-driven game with well thought-out gameplay mechanics. 
Though the project remained in a prototype stage I still had a lot of fun developing it and I was able to explore a lot of interesting game design ideas.<br>

Both the isometric look of the game and the story-heavy elements I had planned were inspired by titles such as Final Fantasy Tactics.

## Portugal Tourism GP 
Portugal Tourism GP! is an isometric platformer pixel art game developed and published on iOS, Android and Steam (Windows, Linux and macOS). Players choose a European stereotype (think baguettes and pizzas) to race through the different locations in Portugal. In each level, players must navigate unique challenges and objectives and try to reach the end of the level with some money left.

This game included competitive features in public leaderboards and also direct competitive races in streamed events, with prizes for the winners. To enable these competitions, I developed secure APIs to connect the game to its server to submit and update the scores. For the race events, I developed a custom Unity app to display the scores, replays, sketches and also allow the players to interact with the stream itself via the game (emotes such as thumbs up, thumbs down, tomatoes, among others).

Finally I developed a website that would show all the information on the game, hosted the APIs and also displayed the leaderboards.

I will be iteratively improving this portfolio and will include in-depth dedicated pages for the main PTGP game and streamer app.
